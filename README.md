# 2_wave_merging_simulation_imagenory_plane

Merging in imagenory plane means collision of two waves making *90°* angle between propagation direction. Simply it means both wave moves perpendicular to eachother and colide at some point. 

# about
This project is created to show basic knowledge about *animation in matplotlib* library and to show its application in math.

Here, in the *animation* folder(Directory) all version are given which helps to build this app from scratch.

Hear, in *for_fun_only* folder(Directory) some crazy thing is available you can also execute that using bellow Execution process.

# Basic introduction
Let Two waves X and Y,
 - X = Asin(at+b)
 - Y = Bsin(ct+d)
 
This simulation shows that by changing the variable A,B,a,b,c,d how X and Y changes and if these two waves are merging in the imagenory plane means,
 - Z = X + i*Y    where, i = √-1
 
 Then how it makes amezing different graphs and different shapes.

### Requirements to Execute code
- Python v3.7
- Matplotlib library
- Numpy library

### Requirements to Understand code
- Python v3.7
- Matplotlib library
- Numpy library
- Text Editor(PyCharm if possible)
- Knowledge about *wave*
- Knowledge about [Sine_wave](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sine_wave)
- Knowledge about [Conic_section](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conic_section)
- Knowledge about [Imagenory numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imaginary_number)
- Knowledge of *basic math*

### Execution Process
- If possible use PyCharm but terminal(console) also works
- Install required libraries
 - pip install matplotlib(matplotlib library)
 - pip install numpy(numpy library)
- Put all .py files in a folder(Directory)
- Execute *app.py* file
- Change variable or use radio button to see different simmulations
